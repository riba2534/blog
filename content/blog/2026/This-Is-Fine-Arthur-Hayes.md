When the fire alarm rings in your apartment or office building, you usually dismiss it. But sometimes death comes swiftly to those who ignore obvious warnings. Given the amount of noise swirling throughout our daily lives, understanding what alarms to heed could save your life or your portfolio.

当公寓或办公楼里的火警响起时，你通常会不以为意。但有时候，死神会迅速降临到那些无视明显警告的人身上。鉴于我们日常生活中充斥着大量噪音，搞清楚哪些警报值得重视，可能会拯救你的命——或者你的投资组合。

Bitcoin is the global fiat liquidity fire alarm. It is the most responsive freely traded asset to the fiat credit supply. The divergence recently between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 Index ("Nasdaq") sounds the alarm that a massive credit destruction event is nigh. Many investors perceive Bitcoin, because of its past correlation with US big tech stonks, as a leveraged play on the Nasdaq. Therefore, when they diverge in performance, it warrants further investigation into any trigger that could cause a destruction of fiat, but mostly dollar, credit, aka DEFLATION!

**比特币是全球法币流动性的火警器。** 它是对法币信贷供应最敏感的自由交易资产。近期比特币与纳斯达克100指数（"Nasdaq"）之间的背离，正在拉响警报——**一场大规模信用毁灭事件即将来临**。许多投资者因为比特币过去与美国大型科技股的相关性，把它视为纳斯达克的杠杆押注。因此，当两者表现出现分化时，就值得深入调查任何可能引发法币——主要是美元——信用毁灭的触发因素，也就是 DEFLATION（通缩）！

Deflation is bad, but ultimately good for fiat credit-sensitive assets like Bitcoin. First, the market prices the impact of severe impairment on debt assets on financial institutions' balance sheets. Then a few of the worst-managed or highest levered financial institutions become insolvent based on their stock price. Finally, the monetary mandarins panic and press that Brrrr button harder than I shred pow the morning after a one-meter dump. The surge in fiat credit creation pumps Bitcoin decisively off its lows, and the future expectation of increased fiat creation to save the banking system propels Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

通缩是坏事，但对比特币这类对法币信贷敏感的资产来说，最终却是好事。首先，市场会对债务资产严重减值给金融机构资产负债表带来的冲击进行定价。然后，一些管理最差或杠杆最高的金融机构会因股价崩盘而资不抵债。最后，那些货币大员们（monetary mandarins）开始恐慌，疯狂按下那个"Brrrr"印钞按钮——比我在一米深的大雪后第二天早上冲粉雪还要猛。法币信贷创造的激增将比特币从低点果断拉起，而市场对未来将增加更多法币发行以拯救银行体系的预期，则推动比特币冲上历史新高。

This process can take years or months. The most severe credit deflationary event of this century was the 2008 GFC.[1] At a high level, the market priced in delinquencies on subprime mortgages offered to the increasing number of poor American folks who lost and would lose their jobs because of the rising Chinese manufacturing juggernaut. China formally entered the WTO in 2001.[2] It took seven years for this policy to bankrupt the over leveraged US banking system mainly because the decision to offshore a manufacturing facility and rejig one's supply chain takes time.

这个过程可能需要数年或数月。本世纪最严重的信贷通缩事件是 **2008年的 GFC（全球金融危机）**。[1] 从宏观层面看，市场对次级抵押贷款的违约进行了定价——这些贷款发放给了越来越多因中国制造业巨轮崛起而失业或即将失业的美国穷人。中国于2001年正式加入 WTO（世界贸易组织）。[2] 这项政策花了七年时间才搞垮了过度杠杆化的美国银行体系，主要是因为将制造工厂转移到海外并重新调整供应链需要时间。

This time around the market will discount the impact on consumer credit and mortgage debt because of the inability of white-collar knowledge worker debt donkeys to meet their monthly payments. These deadbeats lack the ability to pay because AI took der jobs!

这一次，市场将对消费信贷和抵押贷款债务的冲击进行折价——原因是那些白领知识工作者"背债驴"（debt donkeys）无法按月还款。**这些赖账鬼还不上钱，因为 AI 抢了他们的饭碗！**

That's a bold statement to call for a financial crisis because of job losses caused by AI adoption. The official narrative is that creative destruction will lead to higher productivity, people will retrain to do who knows what, and utopia will reign in Pax Americana. This is the economic dogma guiding the Trump administration. They believe AI will drive productivity growth so high that they can simultaneously lower interest rates and reduce the debt load paid for by taxes from corporate profits due to 15% real GDP growth per year. Yes, 15 fucking percent, that's what the big man Trump proclaimed. However, before this glorious American future handed down by a Caucasian male Christian god can occur, millions of high-earning, debt-laden, white-collar plebes will lose their jobs. The banking system will buckle under the assumed losses on its holdings of consumer credit loans and mortgages.

因为 AI 导致的失业就预言一场金融危机——这话说得够大胆的。官方叙事是：创造性毁灭将带来更高的生产力，人们会接受再培训去做天知道什么工作，然后乌托邦将降临美利坚治世（Pax Americana）。这就是指导特朗普政府的经济教条。他们相信 AI 将把生产力增长推到如此之高，以至于可以同时降低利率并减少债务负担——因为企业利润带来的税收将支撑每年 **15%的实际 GDP 增长**。没错，**他妈的15%**，这就是大人物特朗普亲口宣称的。然而，在这个由白人男性基督教上帝恩赐的辉煌美国未来到来之前，数百万高收入、高负债的白领平民将失去工作。银行体系将在消费信贷和抵押贷款的预期损失下不堪重负。

First, I will step through my simple model that predicts in broad strokes the quantum of credit losses in store for US commercial banks. Next, I will present the early warning signs offered by Bitcoin and software SaaS stonk price action. Finally, I can speak to the political sclerosis at the Fed that will cause them to dither until shit gets really bad. The worse the fall, the harder the central wanker bankers press that Brr button. This AI financial crisis will restart the money printing machine for realz. But don't get it twisted. There are two scenarios for Bitcoin and shitcoins. Either Bitcoin's dump from $126,000 to $60,000 was the entire downward move and stonks will catch up, or Bitcoin will dump further as stocks meet their maker. It behooves punters to limit the use of leverage and wait for the all-clear from the Fed that it's time to dump filthy fiat and ape into risky assets with wanton abandon.

首先，我将逐步展示我的简单模型，用它来粗略预测美国商业银行将面临的信贷损失规模。接下来，我将展示比特币和软件 SaaS 股票价格走势所提供的预警信号。最后，我会谈谈美联储的政治僵化——这将导致他们一直磨磨蹭蹭，直到局面彻底烂透。跌得越狠，那些中央银行的废物们（central wanker bankers）就会把"Brr"按钮按得越死。**这场 AI 金融危机将真正重启印钞机。** 但别搞混了——比特币和山寨币面临两种情景：要么比特币从 **$126,000 跌到 $60,000** 就是全部跌幅，股市随后跟上；要么比特币会继续下跌，与股市一起见阎王。赌徒们最好限制杠杆的使用，等待美联储发出"全面解除警报"的信号——届时就该抛掉肮脏的法币，毫无顾忌地冲进风险资产。

## Anatomy of Default

## 违约解剖

The model's objective is to predict, using valid assumptions, the total approximate amount of consumer credit and mortgage defaults attributed to white-collar knowledge workers being replaced by AI tools like Claude.

该模型的目标是，基于合理假设，预测因白领知识工作者被 Claude 等 AI 工具取代而导致的消费信贷和抵押贷款违约的大致总额。

According to the US BLS, there are currently 72.1 million knowledge workers out of a total working population of 164.5 million. [3]

根据美国劳工统计局（BLS）的数据，在总计 **1.645亿** 的劳动人口中，目前有 **7210万** 知识工作者。[3]

These knowledge workers earn more on average than other Americans and thus power the empire's consumer-led economy. I am interested in estimating on average how much consumer credit (e.g. credit card balances, auto loans etc.) they shoulder. According to the Fed, the total amount of consumer credit is $5.1 trillion. Because I'm only interested in loans the banking system holds as assets on its balance sheet, I must strip out student loans, which are usually underwritten by the government. Doing this brings the total down to $3.76 trillion.

这些知识工作者的平均收入高于其他美国人，因此支撑着帝国以消费为导向的经济。我感兴趣的是估算他们平均背负多少消费信贷（如信用卡余额、汽车贷款等）。根据美联储的数据，消费信贷总额为 **5.1万亿美元**。因为我只关注银行体系作为资产持有在资产负债表上的贷款，所以必须剔除通常由政府承保的学生贷款。这样处理后，总额降至 **3.76万亿美元**。

These high flyers also borrow money to purchase their dwelling. The average annual income of a knowledge worker is $85,000, which places them around the 70th percentile of income earners. Folks in this decile have a homeownership rate of 74% and on average 42% of homeowners have a mortgage. Knowledge workers carry an approximate average mortgage balance of $250,000.[4]

这些高收入者也借钱买房。知识工作者的平均年收入为 **$85,000**，大约处于收入分布的第70百分位。这一阶层的住房拥有率为 **74%**，平均 **42%** 的房主背有抵押贷款。知识工作者的平均抵押贷款余额约为 **$250,000**。[4]

With these inputs, the next step is to calculate the losses to banks if 20% of knowledge workers vanished because of AI. I know that CEOs or lead researchers at various prominent AI companies call for an almost complete eradication of most knowledge work performed by humans within the next two years. While that may be true in the longer term, I want to know if even a modest culling of these folks would cause a financial crisis. For example, China's entry into the WTO deaded 35% of Americans working in the manufacturing industry over the next few decades. Blue-collar workers manipulate atoms, which are harder to move from one place to another than bits. Knowledge workers manipulate bits, which can move at the speed of light. Therefore, because AI similarly manipulates digital symbols faster than a human, the pace of white vs. blue-collar job losses will be much faster. The labor market in the US is very flexible and employers can fire folks at will with little to no financial consequences, unlike more socialist countries in Europe or Asia, e.g. Japan. Therefore, a profit maximizing corporation will quickly fire a sizable chunk of its knowledge workers if the AI tools are 10 or 100 times faster than a qualified human.

有了这些输入，下一步是计算如果 **20%的知识工作者因 AI 而消失**，银行将遭受多大损失。我知道各大知名 AI 公司的 CEO 或首席研究员声称，未来两年内人类执行的大部分知识工作将被几乎完全消灭。虽然从长远来看这可能是真的，但我想知道的是，即便只是温和地裁掉这些人，是否就足以引发一场金融危机。举个例子，中国加入 WTO 在随后几十年里干掉了美国制造业 **35%** 的工人。蓝领工人操控的是原子，原子比比特更难从一个地方搬到另一个地方。知识工作者操控的是比特，比特可以以光速移动。因此，因为 AI 同样以比人类更快的速度处理数字符号，白领对比蓝领的失业速度将快得多。美国劳动力市场非常灵活，雇主可以随意解雇员工，几乎不承担任何财务后果——不像欧洲或亚洲那些更偏社会主义的国家，比如日本。因此，一家追求利润最大化的公司会在 AI 工具比合格的人类快10倍或100倍时，迅速解雇相当大一部分知识工作者。

The market will assume unemployed workers cannot meet their monthly payments on consumer credit and mortgages. Then the banks that survive will severely restrict the amount of consumer and mortgage lending because they do not know how the previously wealthiest workers will earn a living in the age of AI. Without the flow of credit, demand for real goods collapses. This is how a banking crisis completely grinds Pax Americana's economy to a halt.

市场将假定失业的工人无法按月偿还消费信贷和抵押贷款。然后，幸存下来的银行将严格限制消费贷款和抵押贷款的发放规模，因为它们不知道这些曾经最富有的工人在 AI 时代将如何谋生。**没有了信贷流动，对实物商品的需求将崩溃。这就是一场银行危机如何将美利坚治世的经济彻底碾碎的。**

### Consumer Credit Losses

### 消费信贷损失

![Consumer Credit Losses](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c5d8d635.png)

The market will price in $330bn of losses to banks consumer credit portfolios.

市场将对银行消费信贷组合计入 **$3300亿** 的损失。

### Mortgage Debt Losses

### 抵押贷款损失

![Mortgage Debt Losses](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c5f70bad.png)

The market will price in $227bn of losses to banks mortgage debt portfolios.

市场将对银行抵押贷款组合计入 **$2270亿** 的损失。

![The Result](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c612ef94.png)

Banks reserve part of profits each quarter against losses on their loan books. The FDIC publishes the industry-wide total loan loss reserves quarterly.[5] Subtracting that from the consumer credit and mortgage debt losses tells us how large of a hit to their equity this AI deflationary event causes. When viewed against the total US commercial bank equity capitalization, this event would cause a 13% write-down.

银行每季度从利润中计提一部分作为贷款损失准备金。FDIC（联邦存款保险公司）每季度公布全行业贷款损失准备金总额。[5] 用消费信贷和抵押贷款损失减去这个准备金，就能告诉我们这场 AI 通缩事件对银行权益造成多大的打击。与美国商业银行总权益资本相比，**这一事件将导致 13% 的减记**。

13% might not seem like a big deal, but not all banks are created equal. There are thousands of banks, and only eight (Too Big to Fail, "TBTF") have a government guarantee because of the post-2008 GFC banking regulations put into place. The TBTF banks will be fine as they are the best capitalized and run banks in the empire. But there will be many cockroach banks that took more risk with the types of folks they lent to or employ much higher balance sheet leverage. The market will sniff out these weak banks and destroy their stock prices. The banks will breach their regulatory capital adequacy ratios, and depositors will flee. This will be a rerun of the regional bank crisis in early 2023 that destroyed three banks in a fortnight. But this time it will be much worse, as the genesis of the crisis is the unstoppable nature of AI, a narrative the market believes and is terrified by. Sell and withdraw first; investigate later. This is how investors and depositors will approach this situation as soon as everyone knows that everyone knows that all white-collar workers will lose out to AI tools and thus cannot pay their bills.

**13%** 听起来好像没什么大不了的，但银行与银行之间天差地别。全美有数千家银行，但只有八家（"大而不能倒"，Too Big to Fail，"TBTF"）因2008年 GFC 后实施的银行业监管而获得政府担保。TBTF 银行会没事的，因为它们是帝国里资本最充足、管理最好的银行。但会有许多"蟑螂银行"——它们在放贷对象上承担了更多风险，或者使用了高得多的资产负债表杠杆。市场会嗅出这些虚弱的银行并摧毁它们的股价。这些银行将突破监管资本充足率红线，储户将仓皇出逃。**这将是2023年初区域银行危机的重演——那场危机在两周内摧毁了三家银行。但这一次会严重得多**，因为危机的根源是 AI 不可阻挡的本质——这是一个市场深信不疑且为之胆寒的叙事。先卖出、先撤资，再说调查的事。这就是当"所有人都知道所有人都知道"所有白领都将输给 AI 工具、因此无法支付账单时，投资者和储户将采取的行动方式。

To put this into context, here are the same numbers for the 2008 GFC.

为了给出参照，以下是2008年 GFC 的同类数据。

![2008 GFC Context](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c672f429.png)

Assuming a 20% almost immediate decline in knowledge workers is about half as deadly as the 2008 GFC. The Fed printed money for over a decade to repair the financial system in response to the 2008 GFC. I expect a similar thrust higher in Fed monetary shenanigans in 2026 once a wide swath of non-TBTF banks will go under if they don't solve their internal political squabbles and print dat money.

假设知识工作者几乎立即减少20%，其破坏力大约是2008年 GFC 的一半。美联储为了应对2008年 GFC，印了十多年的钱来修复金融体系。**我预计，一旦大量非 TBTF 银行面临倒闭，美联储在2026年将出现类似的货币骚操作大幅升级**——前提是他们能搞定内部的政治内斗，然后把钱印出来。

## AI Destruction Chart Porn

## AI 毁灭图表秀

As always, my guiding light in investing is fiat credit creation. Let's start with my USD liquidity index.

一如既往，我投资的指路明灯是法币信贷创造。让我们从我的美元流动性指数开始。

![USD Liquidity Index](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c690c139.png)

As you can see, falling liquidity forces the market on the dwindling prospects for certain tech businesses because of AI adoption.

如你所见，**流动性下降**迫使市场重新审视某些科技企业因 AI 普及而日益黯淡的前景。

![IGV vs Nasdaq](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c6aa3874.png)

If AI tools like Anthropic's Claude Cowork can reliably complete tasks in minutes, that would take a human hours or days, why do you need all those SaaS productivity subscriptions? The market came after the tools of knowledge workers first. That is why the iShares Software ETF IGV (white) which represents listed software SaaS businesses, tanked vs. the broader Nasdaq (gold).

如果像 Anthropic 的 Claude Cowork 这样的 AI 工具能在几分钟内可靠地完成人类需要数小时甚至数天才能完成的任务，**你还需要那些 SaaS 生产力订阅干嘛？** 市场首先对知识工作者的工具开刀。这就是为什么代表上市软件 SaaS 企业的 iShares Software ETF IGV（白线）相对于更广泛的纳斯达克指数（金线）**暴跌**。

![Blue Owl vs IGV](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c6cdc55a.png)

Then the market attacked those non-bank lenders who lent to these SaaS businesses. Blue Owl (white), the former market darling in the private credit space, got owned alongside IGV (gold).

然后市场又对那些向这些 SaaS 企业放贷的非银行贷款机构下手。Blue Owl（白线），这个曾经在私募信贷领域红极一时的市场宠儿，跟着 IGV（金线）一起**被血洗**。

Now that the market believes fewer sales of SaaS tools to knowledge workers, it is time to discount the impact to various sectors if the users of those tools find themselves irrelevant as well.

既然市场已经认定面向知识工作者的 SaaS 工具销量将减少，那么现在是时候重新评估——如果这些工具的使用者本身也变得无关紧要，各行各业将受到怎样的冲击。

First, let's observe what's happening at the base of the credit pyramid; as some workers lose their jobs, delinquencies rise.

首先，让我们看看信贷金字塔底部正在发生什么——随着一部分工人失去工作，**逾期率开始攀升**。

![Credit Card Delinquencies](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c7208498.png)

![Credit Card Delinquencies Detail](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c738de7c.png)

If the consumer cannot meet their monthly credit card payments, the next sector hit is consumer discretionary stocks.

如果消费者连每月的信用卡账单都还不上，下一个被打击的板块就是**可选消费股**。

![XLP vs XLY Ratio](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c756612b.png)

The above chart is the ratio of the SPDR Consumer Staples ETF (XLP US) to the SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF (XLY US). As you can see by the rising ratio as of late, XLP is massively outperforming XLY. This means the plebes shop more at discount retailers like Walmart than mindlessly ordering knick-knacks on Amazon or overpaying for Tesla EVs. Walmart and Amazon/Tesla are the largest weightings in XLP and XLY, respectively.

上图是 SPDR 必需消费品 ETF（XLP US）与 SPDR 可选消费品 ETF（XLY US）的比值。如你所见，近期这个比值不断攀升，**XLP 正在大幅跑赢 XLY**。这意味着平民百姓更多地去沃尔玛这样的折扣零售商购物，而不是在亚马逊上无脑下单买小玩意儿，或者花冤枉钱买特斯拉电动车。沃尔玛和亚马逊/特斯拉分别是 XLP 和 XLY 中权重最大的成分股。

![AXP vs IGV](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c77bf16f.png)

The financial institutions that cater to the soon to be broke as fuck white-collar workers like American Express (AXP US in white) held serve while the employers of their borrowers (IGV US in gold) got punished by the markets. But lenders' outperformance will wane as the market fully prices in the future culling of knowledge workers.

那些服务于即将穷得叮当响的白领阶层的金融机构，比如美国运通（AXP US，白线），在其借款人的雇主们（IGV US，金线）遭到市场惩罚时还稳住了阵脚。但随着市场充分消化未来知识工作者大规模被淘汰的预期，**贷款机构的超额收益将逐渐消退**。

When in doubt about whether USD liquidity is ample, turn to Bitcoin.

当你拿不准美元流动性是否充裕时，看看比特币就知道了。

![Bitcoin vs Nasdaq](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c7c6e559.png)

Nasdaq (gold) is flat whilst Bitcoin (white) plunged since Bitcoin hit its all-time high in October 2025.

自 **2025 年 10 月比特币创下历史新高**以来，纳斯达克（金线）横盘震荡，而比特币（白线）则大幅跳水。

![Gold vs Bitcoin](https://image-1252109614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2026/02/18/69956c7e3cb95.png)

A surging gold (gold) versus a slumping Bitcoin (white) clearly tells us that a deflationary risk-off credit event within Pax Americana is brewing.

**黄金飙升**（金线）对比**比特币低迷**（白线），清楚地告诉我们：一场美利坚治世体系内的通缩性避险信贷事件正在酝酿之中。

## A Dithering Fed

## 犹豫不决的美联储

If we all know empirically that eventually the Fed prints money to save the banking system from credit loss created deflation, then why isn't Bitcoin soaring as AI-related knowledge worker job losses accelerate? Because in order to act bigly, the Fed always needs a crisis.

如果我们从经验上都知道美联储最终会印钞来拯救银行体系、对抗信贷损失导致的通缩，那为什么在 AI 相关的知识工作者失业加速时，比特币没有飙升呢？因为**要想搞大动作，美联储永远需要一场危机**。

In the lead-up to the 2008 GFC, the mantra was that "US housing prices never fall". If they never fall, then there is nothing to worry about if two random Bear Stern hedge funds bit the dust because of subprime mortgage losses in 2007. Similarly, today the mantra is that "AI will lead the highest productivity growth ever". Again, why should the Fed act if some fugazi magic internet money token crashed or a few high-flying shadow banks got their comeuppance for lax underwriting standards?

在 2008 年全球金融危机（GFC）爆发前夕，流行的咒语是**"美国房价永远不会跌"**。如果永远不会跌，那两只不知名的贝尔斯登对冲基金因为次贷亏损在 2007 年爆雷又有什么好担心的？同样，今天的咒语是**"AI 将带来有史以来最高的生产力增长"**。既然如此，如果某个不入流的神奇互联网代币崩了，或者几家飞得太高的影子银行因为放贷标准松懈而遭到报应，美联储凭什么要出手？

To add to the inertia preventing the Fed from acting is the political crisis that engulfs it. US President Trump crossed the Rubicon and launched a criminal investigation into the Fed chairperson beta cuck towel bitch boy Powell. Like any institution made up of human cells, when you threaten the ideological glue that defines folks and their supposed broader mission, they band together. Those within the Fed truly believe they are independent and above politics, even though the historical record is very clear that the Fed always delivers the monetary policy the president desires, eventually. By criminally investigating Powell ostensibly because he refused to lower interest rates and print money fast enough, Powell's pride might seriously compel him to remain on the Fed board of governors when his chair term is up in May. At that point, assuming Trump can get his pick for chairperson to be confirmed by the Senate, which is not a given, Kevin Warsh will preside over a hostile Fed.

让美联储更加难以行动的，还有将其吞噬的政治危机。美国总统特朗普**破釜沉舟**，对美联储主席——那个窝囊废软蛋鲍威尔——发起了刑事调查。任何由人组成的机构都一样，当你威胁到定义这些人身份认同和所谓崇高使命的意识形态纽带时，他们就会抱团。美联储内部的人真心相信自己是独立的、超越政治的，尽管历史记录清清楚楚：**美联储最终总是会交出总统想要的货币政策**。通过以鲍威尔拒绝足够快地降息和印钞为名对其进行刑事调查，鲍威尔的自尊心很可能会驱使他在 5 月主席任期届满后继续留在美联储理事会。届时，假设特朗普能让他选定的主席人选获得参议院确认——这可不是板上钉钉的事——Kevin Warsh 将执掌一个充满敌意的美联储。

Warsh is supposedly in favor of a smaller Fed balance sheet and wants to institute many other "radical" changes to how the Fed operates and regulates the banking industry. Whether these are sound policies in the minds of other governors isn't relevant; Warsh is Trump's chairperson. And if Powell remains and carries at least five other voting governors in his camp, he can obstruct Trump's agenda and preserve the Fed's political independence through inaction.

据说 Warsh 主张缩减美联储资产负债表，并且想要在美联储运作方式和银行业监管方面推行许多其他"激进"改革。其他理事是否认为这些是好政策并不重要——**Warsh 是特朗普的人**。而如果鲍威尔留任并拉拢至少五位投票理事站在他那边，他就可以通过**按兵不动**来阻挠特朗普的议程，捍卫美联储的政治独立性。

While the Fed is fighting windmills, AI-related job losses will destroy the balance sheets of American banks. And then, finally, the non-TBTF banking stocks will start crashing, depositors will flee to safety in JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon's arms, and credit markets will seize up. The market will frantically ask which credit sector is next to experience the wrath of AI optimization? And because scared traders optimize for immediate liquidity, they will dump everything. The stock market collapses and Bitcoin trades sideways, or Bitcoin slices through $60,000 and continues going until the Fed gins up the money printer.

当美联储还在跟风车作战的时候，AI 相关的失业潮将摧毁美国银行的资产负债表。然后，终于，**非"大而不能倒"（non-TBTF）的银行股将开始崩盘**，储户会逃向安全港、投入摩根大通 CEO 杰米·戴蒙的怀抱，信贷市场将冻结。市场将疯狂追问：下一个遭受 AI 优化之怒的信贷板块是谁？而因为恐慌的交易员优先追求即时流动性，他们会**抛售一切**。股市崩盘，比特币要么横盘震荡，要么**一路跌穿 60,000 美元继续下探**——直到美联储重新启动印钞机。

## What About the Discount Window?

## 贴现窗口呢？

In theory, if a US-regulated bank or bank branch runs into trouble where it needs to sell assets quickly to meet depositor withdrawals, it can access the Fed's discount window. The problem with the discount window is that it assumes that the problem is purely one of duration mismatch and liquidity. However, in this circumstance, the loans on the balance sheet are worth zero because of an inability to pay by the borrower.

理论上，如果一家受美国监管的银行或银行分支机构陷入困境，需要快速出售资产以应对储户提款，它可以使用美联储的贴现窗口（Discount Window）。贴现窗口的问题在于，它假设问题纯粹是**久期错配（duration mismatch）和流动性（liquidity）**的问题。然而，在这种情况下，资产负债表上的贷款价值为**零**——因为借款人根本无力偿还。

Once AI takes your accountancy, legal, investment banking, etc. jobs, they ain't coming back. Maybe after a few years of retraining, you can get another job in whatever newfangled employment sector emerges because of AI, but that will take many years if it happens at all. You cannot service your debts in the meantime, and the market will price that collateralized auto loan debt obligation as zero. This would violate the Fed's underwriting standards, and to provide a blank amount of printed money to banks to coerce them to lend again to deadbeat former masters of the universe will take a complete overhaul of how the discount window operates. And unfortunately, that sort of change will require new policies that the governors must vote upon.

一旦 AI 抢走了你的会计、法律、投行等工作，**这些饭碗就再也回不来了**。也许经过几年的再培训，你能在 AI 催生的某个新兴行业找到另一份工作，但那得花上好多年——前提是真能找到的话。在此期间你根本无法偿还债务，市场会把那些以汽车贷款为抵押的债务定价为**零**。这将违反美联储的承销标准，而要向银行提供无限量的印钞、逼迫它们再次向这些曾经的"宇宙主宰"——如今的老赖们——放贷，就需要对贴现窗口的运作方式进行**彻底的改革**。不幸的是，这种变革需要新的政策，而这些政策必须经过美联储理事们的投票表决。

## Print Baby Print!

## 印钞吧宝贝！

Everyone knows that everyone knows that AI is the most transformative general-purpose technology in human history. The consensus also believes that once AI comes for the arrogant college educated paper pushing lawyer, Lord Elon or more likely his Chinese competitors, will launch AI-powered robots that reduce the price of labor to near zero. Faced with these "truths", the Fed must print bigger than it's ever printed before. And the best part is that the politicians are so afraid of AI-sponsored credit deflation, they will gladly support another round of QE infinity. [6]

所有人都知道所有人都知道，AI 是人类历史上**最具变革性的通用技术**。共识还认为，一旦 AI 干掉了那些傲慢的、受过大学教育的、整天推纸头的律师们，伊隆大人——或者更可能是他的中国竞争对手们——就会推出 AI 驱动的机器人，将**劳动力价格压到接近零**。面对这些"真理"，美联储必须比以往任何时候都**更大规模地印钞**。最妙的是，政客们太害怕 AI 引发的信贷通缩了，他们会**欣然支持又一轮无限量 QE（量化宽松）**。[6]

There are many ways to print money; I will not speculate on how. But just like on Sunday, 12 March 2023, after Signature Bank collapsed, there will be an emergency announcement. Buffalo Bill Bessent and whoever the Fed chairperson is at the time will announce some joint program that in effect prints money.[7] And then wham bam thank you ma'am it's time to back up the fucking truck and buy Bitcoin and shitcoins like it's 2020.

印钞的方式有很多种；我就不在这里猜测具体怎么操作了。但就像 **2023 年 3 月 12 日（周日）**，Signature Bank 倒闭后那样，一定会有一个紧急公告。"水牛比尔" Bessent 和届时的美联储主席将宣布某个联合计划，实质上就是**印钞**。[7] 然后——砰砰砰谢谢您嘞——是时候把他妈的卡车倒过来，像 2020 年那样**疯狂买入比特币和山寨币**了。

## Stay Nimble

## 保持灵活

Because AI models now build their next iteration, the pace of improvement occurs non-linearly. This means that if you operate on the assumption that AI isn't accurate enough to do some knowledge-related tasks because you tried last year, your opinion is out of date. Shit is getting real, and millions of knowledge workers will swallow their pride and apply for a government handout like a welfare king or queen from the hood.

因为 AI 模型现在能自己构建下一代版本，改进的速度呈**非线性**增长。这意味着，如果你因为去年试过就认为 AI 不够准确、干不了某些知识类工作，那你的看法**已经过时了**。事情正在变得非常真实，数以百万计的知识工作者将不得不咽下自尊，像街区里的"福利王"或"福利女王"一样去**申请政府救济**。

I don't believe Bitcoin traders will see through to the eventual Fed banking bailout until consumer credit-sensitive stocks experience serious pain. I won't short the market, but long selling to raise cash if one hasn't done so might be prudent. If an asset's price drops from 10 to 5, a short makes 50%, but when the price rebounds from 5 to 10, a long doubles their money. Therefore, the game is to be liquid, nimble, and play for the rebound. Shorting is a mug's game. Always Be Longing Convexity!

我不认为比特币交易者会提前看到美联储最终的银行救助——**除非消费信贷敏感型股票经历严重的阵痛**。我不会做空市场，但如果你还没有的话，**卖出多头仓位以筹集现金**可能是明智的。如果一项资产的价格从 10 跌到 5，做空赚 **50%**；但当价格从 5 反弹到 10 时，做多的人赚了**一倍**。因此，这场游戏的关键是**保持流动性、保持灵活、等待反弹**。做空是傻瓜的游戏。**永远做多凸性（Convexity）！**

The top two shitcoins that Maelstrom will deploy excess stables into once the Fed blinks are $ZEC (Zcash) and $HYPE (Hyperliquid). In my next essay, I will present my model for why $HYPE will trade to $150 by July, which is ~5x higher than current levels. Obviously, we are already long $ZEC and $HYPE, but I want moar, and if my AI financial crisis thesis is correct, there will be another opportunity to acquire more of these high-quality shitcoins on sale.

一旦美联储眨眼，Maelstrom 将把多余的稳定币投入的**前两大山寨币**是 **$ZEC（Zcash）** 和 **$HYPE（Hyperliquid）**。在我的下一篇文章中，我将展示我的模型，解释为什么 **$HYPE 将在 7 月前交易到 150 美元**，比当前水平高出约 **5 倍**。显然，我们已经做多了 $ZEC 和 $HYPE，但我还想要更多，如果我的 AI 金融危机论点是正确的，将会有另一个机会**以折扣价买入更多这些高质量的山寨币**。
